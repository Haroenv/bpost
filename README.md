## Installation

Install via [yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn)

	yarn add bpost (--dev)

or npm

	npm install bpost (--save-dev)


If you don't use a package manager, you can [access `bpost` via unpkg (CDN)](https://unpkg.com/bpost/), download the source, or point your package manager to the url.

`bpost` is compiled as a collection of [CommonJS](http://webpack.github.io/docs/commonjs.html) modules & [ES2015 modules](http://www.2ality.com/2014/09/es6-modules-final.html) for bundlers that support the `jsnext:main` or `module` field in package.json (Rollup, Webpack 2)

The `bpost` package includes precompiled production and development [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) builds in the [`dist` folder](https://unpkg.com/bpost/dist/). They can be used directly without a bundler and are thus compatible with many popular JavaScript module loaders and environments. You can drop a UMD build as a [`<script>` tag](https://unpkg.com/bpost) on your page. The UMD builds make `bpost` available as a `window.bpost` global variable.<sup>*1*</sup>

This module was created using the magnificent [generator-module-boilerplate](https://github.com/duivvv/generator-module-boilerplate).

## Usage
Take a look at the [documentation](http://bpostjs.me) to get an in-depth use case scenario and more guidelines.
